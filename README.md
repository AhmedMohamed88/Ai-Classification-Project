Ai Classification Project

Healthcare Stroke Prediction System:
This project aims to develop an AI model to analyze patient data and
predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on various medical and
demographic attributes. Machine learning techniques, specifically
classification algorithms, will be employed to build an efficient and
accurate model.
Classification Task: Classify patients as "at risk of stroke" or "not at risk
of stroke" based on demographic, medical history, and lifestyle factors.
Use classification models to identify patterns that differentiate high-risk
individuals.
Dataset Overview:
the dataset includes these columns :

▪ id: Unique identifier for each patient
▪ gender: Male or Female
▪ age: Age of the patient
▪ hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
▪ heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
▪ ever_married: Marital status (Yes/No)
▪ work_type: Type of employment (Private, Self-employed,
Govt_job, etc.)
▪ Residence_type: Urban or Rural
▪ avg_glucose_level: Average blood glucose level
▪ bmi: Body Mass Index
▪ smoking_status: Smoking behavior (Never smoked,
Formerly smoked, Smokes, Unknown)
▪ stroke: Target variable (0 = No Stroke, 1 = Stroke)

Project Requirements:
1. Preprocessing: Before building your classification models, you need
to make sure that the dataset is processed, clean and ready-to-use.
2. Feature selection: Try different feature selection techniques.
3. Classification:
• Train 4 different classification models (e.g., Logistic regression,
SVM and Decision tree, Knn).
• Choose at least two hyperparameters to vary and explain the impact
varying those two hyperparameters with different values.
• Train the models on the given training set and evaluate the model on
the given testing set.
4. Model Evaluation: You should try different evaluation metrics to
evaluate your model:
• Accuracy
• Precision & recall
• Confusion matrix
